<h3>About this document / Introduction</h3>

The purpose of this document is to provide some information about
GCN Scalar - Type A.


<h3>About GCN Scalar - Type A</h3>

GCN Scalar - Type A is a puzzle game where an image file is divided up
into pieces which are then shuffled and the player has to reassemble
the image by rearranging the shuffled pieces.

GCN Scalar - Type A is a fork from version 1.02 of "Scalar" by Milan
Babuskov.

Version 1.02 of "Scalar" was obtained from the program's project
repository hosted at the web-based project hosting service provider
SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/ at the time of writing).

Scalar is licenced under the GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)
and thus GCN Scalar - Type A is also licenced under GNU General Public
License version 2.0 (GPLv2)


<h3>Implementations</h3>

Implementations are forks of GCN Scalar - Type A. The concept behind
this scheme is to provide flexibility to attempt to "implement" the
same general program using different developement methods.

The implementations that have currently been released are as follows:

- Imp00001
    
    The purpose of this implementation is to predominantly use the C
    and/or C++ programming languages along with the Simple DirectMedia
    Layer (SDL) 1.2.X API to develop versions of GCN Scalar - Type A
    that will run on systems that use versions of the Microsoft Windows
    operating system that run on 32bit x86 compatible system architecture.
    
    [ Target platform(s): Microsoft Windows on 32bit x86 compatible systems ]
